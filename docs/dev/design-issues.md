## Phase 6 — Polish & Deploy

- [ ] **Poor text contrast on hover (experience-step)** — selected/hovered card has white text on pink/purple background; description text barely readable. Need higher contrast or dark text on accent background.
- [ ] **Assessment: "answer accepted" micro-feedback** — without correct/incorrect feedback, add a subtle UI animation (e.g., brief checkmark or pulse) to confirm the answer was registered before showing the next question.
- [ ] **Onboarding: visual stepper indicator** — the onboarding flow switches between screens but has no step indicator (dots, progress bar, or numbered steps). Add a visual stepper showing current position in the Welcome → Experience → Goal → Assessment flow.
