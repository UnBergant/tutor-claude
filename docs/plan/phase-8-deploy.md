# Phase 8: Polish & Deploy

## Goal
Finalization, E2E tests, deployment.

## Steps

1. **E2E tests (Playwright)** — full path: login → assessment → lesson → chat
2. **Performance** — lazy loading, image optimization, API caching
3. **Mobile-first polish** — mobile device checks, touch interactions
4. **Deploy** — Vercel (web), Railway (api + PostgreSQL), env vars, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
5. **Update docs** — CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, README.md

## Verification
- E2E tests pass
- App works on production URL
- Mobile UI correct
