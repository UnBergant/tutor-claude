## Goal
Personal dictionary, spaced review, streak, progress dashboard.

## Steps

1. **Personal Vocabulary** — auto-collect from lessons/chats, flashcard review, topic grouping
2. **Spaced Repetition** — interval algorithm (1d → 3d → 7d → 30d), reset on error, integrated in Deep Review
3. **Mistake Journal** — categories, patterns, topic links, progress dynamics
4. **Gamification** — streak counter, lessons completed, accuracy %, phrase of the day

## Verification
- Words auto-added to dictionary, flashcards work
- Spaced repetition calculates intervals correctly
- Streak counted, progress displayed
