# Phase 5: Curriculum & Lessons

## Goal
Dynamic modules, lessons from 5-minute blocks, home screen.

## Steps

1. **Home Screen** — quick start, new topics, deep review, progress dashboard, phrase of the day
2. **Lesson Flow** — store, lesson = sequence of 5-min blocks, review → new material → exercises
3. **Curriculum Generation** — backend service, adaptation based on progress and mistakes
4. **Module Selection UI** — cards with difficulty, user choice, override option

## Verification
- Home screen shows all sections
- User picks module → completes lesson → progress saved
- AI adapts program based on results
